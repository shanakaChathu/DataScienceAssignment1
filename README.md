# DataScience Assignment - Group 1
### Sample: 
This sample is taken for an age group between 30-50. Sample contains bias records such as over 60% married people and poeple with zero salary information.
- Remove outliers: some values were drastically different than majority, e.g. : 98 kids. For better results those outliers were removed before hand.

### Hypothesis / Questions
•	People with age over 40 years earnings are different than the people with age less than 40 years earnings.
•	People with age over 40 years working hours are different than the people with age less than 40 years working hours.
•	Earnings of people with high educational levels are different than earnings of the people with low educational levels
•	Working hours of the people with high educational levels are different than the working hours of the people with low educational levels
•	There is a difference between earnings of married and other people

### Assumptions
•	NA, 98, 99 are codes to identify missing values. Because of that we excluded records with NA, 98, 99 from our analysis.
•	Earnings and Hours contains zeros. We assumed these people might not possible to be the Unemployed. These zeros are there because of those individuals didn’t respond to that question in the survey.
